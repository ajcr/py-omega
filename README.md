# py-omega

Transfinite ordinal arithmetic in Python, printed in beautiful LaTeX.

*Currently a work in progress*

The aim of this project is to allow transfinite ordinals to be easily constructed and compared, and then added, multiplied or raised to transfinite powers.

## Notes

Works with Python 3.2 and higher. Use in a Jupyter/IPython notebook/qtconsole to have the output properly rendered (this makes working with ordinals much, much easier).

Here's a quick demonstration:

(Don't worry, simple ways to construct ordinals are next on the agenda.)

## Future

To be implemented very soon...

- Ordinal addition.
- Ordinal multiplication.
- Ordinal exponentiation.
- Better constructors for ordinals.
- Visualisation of small countable ordinals (maybe).
- More exotic species of ordinals (maybe).
