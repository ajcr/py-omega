# py-omega

Transfinite ordinal arithmetic in Python, printed in beautiful LaTeX.

*Currently a work in progress*

The infinite made simple. Allows transfinite ordinals to be easily constructed and compared, and then added, multiplied or raised to transfinite powers.

## Overview

Works with Python 3.2 and higher. Use in a Jupyter/IPython notebook/qtconsole to have the output properly rendered (this makes working with ordinals much, much easier).

Here's a quick demonstration:

Create initial ordinals with the `omega` function:

Perform arithmetic to build more complicated ordinals. All ordinals are represented in Cantor normal form:

Use the module to compute fiddly/tedious arithmetic:

## Future

To be implemented very soon...

- Ordinal exponentiation.
- Visualisation of small countable ordinals (maybe).
- More exotic species of ordinals (maybe).

Bug reports and feature requests are welcomed, as are pull requests.
